# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

A supervised machine learning model to classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant using clinical features. Built with real-world medical datasets, this project aims to assist early cancer diagnosis through automated, explainable predictions.

## Features
- Binary classification: **Malignant** vs **Benign**
- Trained on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**
- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world clinical data
- High accuracy achieved with models like **Decision Tree**, **Random Forest**, and **Logistic Regression**
- Performance evaluation using metrics: **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **F1 Score**

---

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
